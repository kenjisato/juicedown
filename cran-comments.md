* This is a new release.

## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added single quotes for package names, software names and APIs in 
  title and description fields of the DESCRIPTION file. Software and package 
  names are now written in proper case.
  
* Added the link to the website of the package in the description field
  of DESCRIPTION.
  
* Modified the documentation of `includeText()`. It now has a proper \value{} entry.
